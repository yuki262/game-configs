# 🎮 Game Config Archive

A personal collection of custom configuration files, naming schemes, and mod lists for my favorite games — starting with **Stardew Valley**. This repository helps me keep everything organized and easily shareable across devices or with friends.

## 🧾 What's Included

- 🌾 **Stardew Valley Mod List**  
  My curated set of essential and aesthetic mods, organized by category.

- 🐔 **Animal Name Lists**  
  Themed names for chickens, cows, goats, pigs, ducks, rabbits, dinosaurs, and more.

- 🗺️ **Farm Map Names**  
  Custom names for each farm map, in line with the style of in-game aesthetics.

- 🔧 **Future Additions**  
  I may include config files, save templates, or custom keybinds for other games as well.

Happy farming! 🌱
